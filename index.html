                            I was born and raised in Germany and nowadays based somewhere between Amsterdam and the world, but dreaming of living in a hippie beach town in Central or South America (my favorite area in the world).

                            Working fully remotely as a freelance psychologist and coach, mental health is a topic close to my heart, also because I have my fair shares of mental struggles. Spiritual practices such as meditation, yoga and breathwork but also Latin dancing have saved my life after a tough burnout, mental rock bottom and spiritual awakening back in 2021.
                            Since then I have been on my journey to find a more meaningful life that resonates with who I really am!

                        <p>
                            After exploring social work in Norway for 2 years I found myself craving to explore  the path of building my idea's online to help people, while also becoming more financially independent.

                        <p>
                            My interests range from meditation practice, reading self-help books, sport activities in nature, cooking, programming and living a more conscious life.
                            My struggles with my mind and body makes it sometimes difficult to work on these aspects of my life which is why I'm excited to be part of our online community where we can support and share our stories with like minded people.
